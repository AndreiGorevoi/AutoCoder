# AutoCoder

AutoCoder is a GitHub repository dedicated to automating the interaction with ChatGPT using GitHub Actions. This project demonstrates how to configure workflows and scripts to streamline automation tasks, such as running custom scripts or integrating with OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT for various tasks such as code generation, testing, and more.

Objectives

This repository contains the basic setup and configuration files required to run GitHub Actions workflows. It will serve as a foundation for future automation processes and interactions with ChatGPT.

Key Features:
GitHub Actions: Configure workflows to automate processes within GitHub using ChatGPT.
Scripts: Store custom scripts that interact with ChatGPT or perform other automation tasks.
Scalability: Provides a modular structure to expand and integrate further workflows and scripts.
Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

.github/workflows/: This directory will hold all workflow configuration files for GitHub Actions. Currently, it contains an empty main.yml file that will be used to define future workflows.
scripts/: This folder is designated for any custom script files. At this stage, it contains an empty script.sh file, which will be utilized in later stages for automation tasks.
Getting Started

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AutoCoder.git
Explore the directories for configuration and scripts that will be expanded in future stages.
Customize workflows by editing the main.yml file to define your GitHub Action workflows.
